Get thresholded image for the each color channel
Open thresholded images if desired (erode then dilate)
For every thresholded image, obtain set of bounding rectangles
For each set of bounding rectangle, dilate the bounding rectangles
Dilation of a rectangle is defined as increasing the width and height of a rectangle object
for each thresholded image in a given set
  if (rect1 overlaps with rect2)
    CC rectangle = rect1 UNION rect 2
    if this is the larges CC rectangle so far
       select thie as current CC rectangle
    end
end
